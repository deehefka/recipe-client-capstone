Recipe Cards Capstone

This project was an attempt to create recipe cards for a specific user to create, update and delete recipes including updating and changing ingredients and instructions associated (through data tables) with each recipe card. The goal was to use Ruby, React and AWS. I was no able, in the time provided, to add multiple tables, React or AWS. This would be a valuable application for anyone needing to keep track of their recipes.

Unsolved problems:

** React ** AWS ** Multiple tables with many to many relationships ** Styling

Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JS

User Stories:

As a user I can create a new recipe As a user I can add ingredients, instructions, notes, etc for each recipe As a user I can see all the recipes/recipe cards As a user I can manipulate each recipe card As a user I can open a recipe As a user I can save a recipe As a user I can delete a recipe or piece of a recipe As a user I can update a recipe or piece of a recipe
